# Telegram-bot-for-paying-for-a-closed-Telegram-channel

The first thing you need to do is load the Python file into the environment (VS, VSC, PYCHARM), making sure that the Python environment version is 3.13.
After adding it, download our libraries:
- pip install asyncio
- pip install aiogram
- pip install aiogram.filters (if you can't download them, skip this step)
- pip install aiocryptopay
- pip install Networks
- pip install Command

Next, enter the token you need to get from BOT_FATHER in BOT_TOKEN.

Enter the token from CRYPTO_BOT in CRYPTO_BOT_TOKEN.
In CHANNEL_ID, enter the ID of the closed Telegram channel (starting with -100).
PRICE_AMOUNT is the subscription cost.
PRICE_CURRENCY is the currency in which you want to pay (USDT, TON, BTC).
NETWORK = leave it alone!

That should be it!
